This code defines a Book class implementing the Comparable<Book> interface, enabling books to be compared by their names, and a BST class (Binary Search Tree) that implements a generic binary search tree for managing key-value pairs where keys are comparable. The BST class includes methods for inserting, deleting, and searching nodes, checking if the tree is empty, determining its size and height, and displaying the tree or specific levels. This combination allows efficient organization and retrieval of Book objects or other comparable keys within a tree structure.
